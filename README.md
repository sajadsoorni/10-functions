# JavaScript - Functions
This repo is for practicing **functions** in JavaScript.  
I'm following along with the course and writing the code myself.

## What’s inside

- Higher-order functions  
- The `bind()` method  
- Closures  

## Why learn this?

Functions are very important in JavaScript.  
In this part, we go deeper to understand how they work.
